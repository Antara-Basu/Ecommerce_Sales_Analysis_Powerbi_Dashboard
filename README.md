# Analyze E-commerce Sales Data Created an Interactive Dashboard Using Power BI.

Objective: My goal was to collaborate with Madhav Stores and develop an efficient dashboard that enables seamless tracking and in-depth analysis of their online sales nationwide in India.
Developed an engaging and interactive dashboard for comprehensive monitoring and analysis of online sales data.

Implemented sophisticated parameters to facilitate detailed exploration within worksheets and provided customization options through filters and slicers.
Established data connections, join new tables, and performed calculations to manipulate data, empowering users to drive visualizations with dynamic parameters.
Leveraged a diverse range of customized visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, scatter charts, line charts, area charts, maps, and slicers, ensuring a rich and informative user experience.
I uploaded datasets to the Power BI Desktop.

Summary of Findings:
The Power BI dashboard provides valuable insights into Madhav Stores' performance, highlighting the top-performing states, popular product categories, preferred payment modes, and valuable customer segments. It offers actionable recommendations for improving sales, profitability, and customer engagement.

Proposed Solutions:

1)Targeting Profitable States: The analysis reveals Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi as the most profitable states. Madhav Stores can allocate more resources and marketing efforts to further enhance sales in these regions.

2)Encouraging Digital Payments: Despite COD being preferred by customers, Madhav Stores can incentivize the use of digital payment methods like UPI, Debit Card, and Credit Card by offering discounts and rewards.

3)Stock Optimization: Focusing on the clothing category, which drives the majority of sales, Madhav Stores can ensure a diverse and well-stocked inventory to cater to customer demands effectively.

4)Subcategory Growth: To boost overall profitability, Madhav Stores can focus on subcategories such as Printers, Bookcases, Saree, Accessories, and Tables, which contribute significantly to profit.

5)Customer Loyalty Programs: Implementing personalized offers and loyalty programs for top customers like Harivansh, Madhav, Madan Mohan, and Shiva can encourage repeat purchases and foster customer retention.
